## (35pt) Sort Colors

Sort an array that contains three colors red, yellow and green in-place such that the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order of red, yellow and green. Integers 0, 1, and 2 are used to represent the color red, yellow, and green respectively. 

No sorting function from any library is allowed or you'll receive zero points. (And most likely they do sort by making more than one passes, so yeah don't bother with them!)

A few examples:

- Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0], Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
- Input: [1,1,1,2,1,0], Output: [0,1,1,1,1,2]
- Input: [1,0,2,0,2], Output: [0,0,1,2,2]

You can assume all 3 numbers 0, 1, 2 exist in the array. 

The solution can only make a single pass (ONE, that is) through the array without any additional array. O(1) space complexity if you know the fancy terms. That means you can only go through the entire array no more than one time. 

### Tests

All tests are provided. DO NOT CHANGE THE TEST FILE ProblemTest1.java

### Communication Points

For 5pt out of this 35pt, at the beginning of the code, describe your algorithm in up to 5 sentences in comments. Zero point if it's missing or exceeds 5 senteces.
