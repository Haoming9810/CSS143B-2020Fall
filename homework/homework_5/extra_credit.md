## (20pt) Extra Credits

Given a binary tree (with root node `root`), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node. The answer can be returned in any order.

```java
public static List<Integer> distanceK(TreeNode<Integer> root, TreeNode<Integer> target, int k) {
    // homework
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    return result;  // place holder
}
```

Use the provided tests as a manual to understand the requirement in details. 

Assume all node values are unique.
