# Midterm 2 Study Guide

## Recursion

- Stoping condition
- Repeated subproblem, and how to fix it? 
- The memory layout for function calls (call stack, heap, stack memory)
- StackOverflowError (why it happens) vs stack buffer overflow attack
- Recursion overhead & limitation
- Code:
  - A dream in a dream
  - Find max number, recursive vs iterative
  - Unique paths, fibonacci sequence, climbing stairs
  - Print single linked list backward with a stack
  - Print single linked list backward with recursion
  - Test the above two with dependency injection (homework 3 and 4)
  - Binary search (recursive and iterative) 

## Binary Tree

- Array vs linked list vs binary search tree (the snapchat username problem)        
- Binary tree, binary search tree, TreeNode, root, leaves
- Pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal (!!!!)
  - All 3 traversal with recurison
  - Pre-order & inorder iteratively
- Code:
  - Height of a tree
  - LCA of a binary tree
  - Search and insertion in a binary search tree

## Dictionary

- Hash function, hash key
- Collision avoidance via chaining
- Array vs Linkedlist vs BST vs Dictionary (the snapchat username problem)
